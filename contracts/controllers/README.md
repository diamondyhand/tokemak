# BalanceTracker

## Description: 
_delegate function permits delegation of balances to account whos balance has not been properly initialized.

### Note:
The code has been adjusted so that the _delegate function also overwrites the token entry of the newDelegateBal, ensuring that it will always be non-zero.
